Rolo by Shel Silverstein

Rolo loves me,
Rolo cares,
Rolo picks me peaches and pears.
Rolo offers me candy and Cokes,
Rolo listens and laughs at me jokes.
Rolo helps when I get in a fight,
Rolo does all my homework at night.
Rolo misses me,
Rolo cries,
Rolo thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Rolo is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Rolo just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Rolo's hand,
In the darkness where Rolo usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Rolo's gone!
